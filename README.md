# JSL10: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

# Introduction

The task was to proceed through three themed "rooms" by debugging and correcting different tasks in each room. The goal is to learn React by getting above the limitations of Vanilla JavaScript.

# Elements Included

The elements in this project were error handling('try/catch'), event listeners, fetching APIs, Set operations, Promises and 'async/await'.

# Reflections

# Areas of Mastery

**Error Handling:** with this project I feel that my use of the 'try/catch' blocks to deal with any errors that could happen when processing or retrieving data was masterful.
**Data Processing:** I think being able to carry out data manipulation tasks including locating the most recent book, identifying similar items in sets, and asynchronously processing navigation instructions shows my growth in my abilities as a developer.

# Challenges Faced
One of the challenges I faced and I think has continued to be a recurring thought is being decisive in terms of how I choose to identify and resolve the bugs. I am well aware that there are many ways to achieve a goal, I just think that the availability of so many methods confuse me sometimes.

# Overall Learning Experience
This project really stretched my mind in terms of experimenting with debugging and attempting to figure out my coding style having been tasked with debugging asynchronous code, handling errors, and improving code robustness. I was also able to add fetching APIs, Set operations and 'async/await' to my skill set.
